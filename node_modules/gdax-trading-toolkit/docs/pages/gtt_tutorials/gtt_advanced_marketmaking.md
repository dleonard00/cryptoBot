## Market-making - a very basic introduction

There are as many trading strategies as there are opinions on trading strategies. This tutorial is going to introduce a relatively low-risk  and passive strategy known as market-making.

This blog post is going to
 * explain what market-making is
 * and how to use the GDAX market maker software to run your own market-making bot on GDAX.

Let me say up front: This bot does not work _out of the box_. It does a _lot_ of the heavy lifting, but you will still need:

* Trading accounts on GDAX and possibly one other exchange, and a set of API keys that have trading permissions.
* Some real money to play with
* An appetite for risk

# Coming Soon

This tutorial is expected to be released October 2017.
